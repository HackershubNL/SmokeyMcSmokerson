# Smokey Mc Smokerson - Smoker Design

## Introduction

After going through many options such as using flower pots, the decision was made to base it on an oil drum.  
The drum does not have as good flow and heat retention charactertics as flower pots or custom making a ceramic thing but it is fairly cheap and large.  
Most components have been modeled after off the shelf items available from hardware, garden and house supply stores.  
The only custom made items are the controller housing and fan mount (laser cut wood) and fan nozzle (3D printed), these will be placed in the `Custom Design Files` folder.

## Structure

The main assembly is `Barrel Smoker Assembly.SLDASM` which consists of multiple single parts and sub assemblies.

## Notes

Creating the air diffuser can be an expensive item due to the pipe size, alternatively use a 1 1/4 inch skin fitting. This is a fitting meant for ship through hull fluid flow.
