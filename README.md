# SmokeyMcSmokerson


## Introduction

This was inspired by the following projects:

## Getting Started

The controller can be used separate from this smoker, meaning that you can use it on your own project. You will only need to place 4 of the 5 thermocouples in your smoker around the grill and have the fan blow into the bottom.

### Building the thing

It is currently in the last stages of design, as soon as the building starts, the build log will be published on: https://hackaday.io/project/165762-smokey-mc-smokerson  

### Running the thing

See Software/Controller for more info.
